Script 1: Find_Mobile_Food_Trucks.py
Test case 1: Test if script is able to read csv using pandas read_csv method
Expected outcome: pandas dataframe should print csv content and it should match number of rows and columns in csv

Test case 2: Test if script can filter values of two columns by hard coding those values. Use 'Applicant' = 'Cochinita' and 'locationid' = 1591822
Expected outcome: Result should be 1 row and 13 columns from the dataframe as these hardcoded values are from same Mobile Food Facility Permit csv that was read into dataframe. Empty array will be retuned if values are outside csv file


Test case 3: Request user to enter 'Applicant' and 'locationid', search pandas dataframe using these two values
Expected outcome: Result should be 1 row and 13 columns from the dataframe as these hardcoded values are from same Mobile Food Facility Permit csv that was read into dataframe. Empty array will be retuned if values are outside csv file

Test case 4: if test case 1 and 2 and 3 are successful then ask user to provide latitude and longitude as inputs. Use these inputs to search for records in dataframe. Result should be 1 row and 13 columns from the dataframe as these hardcoded values are from same Mobile Food Facility Permit csv that was read into dataframe. Empty array will be retuned if values are outside csv file
